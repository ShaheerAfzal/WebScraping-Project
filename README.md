# WebScraping-Project
> **Note:** You can edit the code and the endpoints to use this for any website you would like, this works best with static websites or ones that don't update too frequently.

This project involves creating a Scrapy spider to extract earnings estimate data from Yahoo Finance. The goal is to collect financial forecasts that analysts provide for various companies, we will only be scraping the Earnings Estimate table for this project.
### How to run:
> **Note:** You need to have scrapy installed to run this, I have it installed in the environment, but if you face any issues try reinstalling it on your end. Learn how to install Scrapy [here](https://scrapy.org/)

After loading up the project in a code editor, open terminal and go to spiders directory by using:
```
cd yScrape/yScrape/spiders
```
once in the spiders directory you can start the spider by writing the command:
```
scrapy crawl yScraper
```
You can make the spider save its scraped data to a file by adding `-o` or `-O` to the end of the crawl command and specifying name of file you want it to create. for example:
```
scrapy crawl yScraper -o EarningsEstimate.csv
```
The `-o` creates a file or adds to an already existing file, whereas the `-O` creates a file or overwrites an existing file. 

## Scrapy Framework:

Scrapy is an open-source web crawling framework written in Python, designed for scraping and extracting data from websites.
A spider will be developed to navigate Yahoo Finance's earnings estimates pages and parse the required data.

### ScrapeOps API:

ScrapeOps is a proxy management solution that provides IP rotation services to avoid IP bans and improve scraping success rates.
The API will be integrated into the Scrapy project to manage IP addresses and rotate them as needed during the scraping process.
Header Randomization:

To mimic human-like requests and evade detection by anti-scraping mechanisms, headers will be randomized for each request.
ScrapeOps API will assist in generating and applying random headers to the requests made by the Scrapy spider.

## Implementation Steps:

### Set Up Scrapy Project:

Initialize a new Scrapy project and create a spider tailored to Yahoo Finance's structure.

### Identify Target Data:

Analyze the Yahoo Finance earnings estimates pages to determine the selectors for the data points you wish to scrape.

### ScrapeOps Integration:

Configure the Scrapy project to use ScrapeOps API for IP rotation and header randomization.
Ensure proper error handling and logging to monitor the scraping process.

### Data Extraction:

Implement parsing methods within the spider to extract and clean the earnings estimate data.
Store the scraped data in a structured format such as CSV, JSON, or a database.

### Testing and Debugging:

Run the spider in a controlled environment to test its functionality and fine-tune the selectors and logic.
Use ScrapeOps dashboard to monitor the success rate and optimize the scraping strategy.

### Deployment:

Once the spider is tested and refined, deploy it to run at scheduled intervals or on-demand to collect the latest earnings estimates data. (this was done locally using task scheduler)

### Data Usage:

Analyze the collected data to identify trends, compare analyst expectations, and make informed decisions based on the earnings estimates.
